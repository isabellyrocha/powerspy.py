powerspy.py
===========

**powerspy.py** is a utility script to measure voltage, current and power in real time using the [Alciom](http://www.alciom.com/) PowerSpy device.

## Prerequisites:

1. [Required] powerspy.py requires python bluez to communicate using bluetooth with the device. It can be installed on Ubuntu using the following command:

		apt-get install python-bluez bluez

2. [Optional, recommended] set up your bluetooth device to connect automatically without asking for PIN.
This can be done by modifying or creating /var/lib/bluetooth/DEVICE/pincodes with the following content: 

		POWERSPY PIN

POWERSPY and DEVICE are the device addresses of the Powerspy and the bluetooth receiver. They can be found with the commands 

		hcitool scan 

and 

		hcitool dev 

respectively.
Then, restart bluetooth:

	sudo restart bluetooth


## Getting started

Use 'powerspy.py -h' to get more information on how to run the utility.


Example of use:

		./powerspy.py 00:0B:CE:07:1D:32
